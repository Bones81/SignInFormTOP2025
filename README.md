This project was part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS module in The Odin Project. 

I have returned many times to The Odin Project for a review of coding fundamentals, and this project was intended to familiarize oneself with HTML forms. The goal was to match a provided form image as closely as possible while implementing any form validations and styles that did not rely on JavaScript. As a result, the form is not linked to any server and does not submit actual data anywhere. Also, this means the "password" and "confirm password" fields are not cross-validated with each other. 

Still surprised at how long it can take to engineer a simple form. Most of the issues, as usual, seem to revolve around styling and match the provided styles. Even with some images and colors provided, the tedium of nailing every design spec still feels like it takes too long.
